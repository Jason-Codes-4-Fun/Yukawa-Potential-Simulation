A few python scripts I used to simulate a closed loop orbit around the yukawa potential

The first file you want to check out is Yukawa Orbit.ipynb, which is he jupyter notebook file that computes the orbit around the potential and creates a GIF and a CSV from our solution data Yukawa_potential_data.csv.

After that you can check out, Yukawa.blend, Yukawa_deformation.py, and Function_Move.py.

Function_Move.py sets keyframe animation data from our CSV file in blender, and Yukawa_deformation.py creates a visual 3d graph of the potential(it's not physically to scale).

You can also check out the blend file to see the set up and special effects if you like, included is the finished GIFs and videos of the animation.
